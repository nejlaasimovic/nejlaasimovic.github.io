## üèóÔ∏è Understanding Your Website Structure

Before we start making changes, let me explain how your website is organized. Think of it like a filing cabinet with different folders for different types of content.

### Main Folders and What They Contain:

| Folder | What's Inside | When You'll Use It |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| `_pages/` | All your main website pages | When updating About, Research, Teaching, CV pages |
| `_bibliography/` | Your publications (papers.bib) | When adding new publications |
| `_news/` | News and announcements | When posting updates or news |
| `_sass/` | Colors, fonts, and styling | When changing how things look |
| `assets/` | Images, PDFs, and media files | When adding photos or documents |
| `_config.yml` | Your personal information | When updating name, title, email, etc. |

### How Your Website Works:
1. **Content** (text, images) goes in specific folders
2. **Configuration** (your info) goes in `_config.yml`
3. **Styling** (colors, fonts) goes in `_sass/` folder
4. **GitHub** automatically builds your website when you make changes

### Making Changes - Two Ways:
1. **Through GitHub.com** (I recommend this) - Edit files directly in your browser
2. **On your computer** - If you have the files downloaded locally

## üé® Customizing Styles, Fonts, and UI

Now let's make your website look exactly how you want it!

### Changing the Main Color Theme

1. **Go to the `_sass` folder**
2. **Click on `_themes.scss` file**
3. **Click the pencil icon (‚úèÔ∏è) to edit**
4. **Find this line and change the color:**

```scss
:root {
  --global-theme-color: #7c4dff;  // Change this color
}
```

### Here are some color options I think would look great:
- **Blue**: `#2196F3`
- **Green**: `#4CAF50`
- **Red**: `#F44336`
- **Orange**: `#FF9800`
- **Purple**: `#9C27B0`
- **Teal**: `#009688`

### Changing Fonts

1. **Go to the `_sass` folder**
2. **Click on `_base.scss` file**
3. **Look for these lines and update them:**

```scss
body {
  font-family: 'Your-Font-Name', 'Roboto', sans-serif;
}

h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
  font-family: 'Your-Header-Font', 'Roboto Slab', serif;
}
```

### Here are some font combinations I recommend:
- **Professional**: Roboto + Roboto Slab
- **Modern**: Open Sans + Lato
- **Academic**: Source Sans Pro + Merriweather
- **Clean**: Inter + Playfair Display

### Customizing Teaching Page Styling

I've set up special styling for your teaching page. To modify it:

1. **Go to `_pages/teaching.md`**
2. **Find the `_styles` section at the top**
3. **Modify the CSS to change colors, spacing, or layout**

Example:
```css
.teaching-item {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #f5f7fa 0%, #c3cfe2 100%);
  border-left: 4px solid var(--global-theme-color);
}
```

## üíª Running Your Website Locally

Sometimes you want to see changes before they go live. Let me show you how to run your website on your own computer:

### Prerequisites:
- Ruby installed on your computer
- Git installed on your computer

### Steps:

1. **Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows)**

2. **Navigate to your website folder:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/website
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

4. **Start the local server:**
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```

5. **Open your browser and go to:**
   ```
   http://localhost:4000
   ```

### What This Does:
- Shows you exactly how your website will look
- Updates automatically when you make changes
- Lets you test changes before publishing (which is really helpful!)

### Stopping the Local Server:
- Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal

## üöÄ Deploying Changes to GitHub

Once you're happy with your changes, here's how to make them live on your website:

### Method 1: Through GitHub.com (I recommend this one)

1. **Make your changes** in any file
2. **Scroll to the bottom** of the edit page
3. **Write a brief description** of what you changed
4. **Click "Commit changes"**
5. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for GitHub to update your website

### Method 2: Using Git Commands (Advanced)

1. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt**
2. **Navigate to your website folder**
3. **Add your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
4. **Commit your changes:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   ```
5. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### After Deploying:
- Your changes will appear on your live website
- It may take 5-10 minutes to update
- You can always make more changes and repeat the process (it gets easier each time!)

## üîß Troubleshooting

Don't worry if something goes wrong - I've got you covered!

### Problem: Changes don't appear on your website
**Solution:** 
- Wait 5-10 minutes, then refresh your website
- Check that you clicked "Commit changes"
- Make sure you didn't get any error messages

### Problem: You see an error message when editing
**Solution:**
- Check that you didn't accidentally delete important symbols like `---` or `{`
- Make sure your text is properly indented
- Click "Cancel" and start over if needed (no worries, it happens to everyone!)

### Problem: Your website looks broken
**Solution:**
- Check that all `---` symbols are still at the top and bottom of files
- Make sure you didn't change any file names
- Try reverting your last change and making it again

### Problem: You can't find a file
**Solution:** 
- Make sure you're in the right folder
- Look for the file name exactly as written (case-sensitive)
- Use the search box in GitHub to find files

### Problem: Local server won't start
**Solution:**
- Make sure Ruby and Git are installed
- Try running `bundle update` first
- Check that you're in the correct directory
- If you're still stuck, don't worry - you can always just use the GitHub method!
