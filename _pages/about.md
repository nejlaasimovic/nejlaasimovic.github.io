Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor in Computational Social Science at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy. Prior to joining Georgetown, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Pennsylvania (Institute for the Study of Citizens and Politics).

My research examines the interplay between digital technologies and intergroup relations within deeply divided societies globally. My work has been published in the *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, *Research & Politics*, and *Political Science Research & Methods*. I was formerly a recipient of the *United States Institute of Peace–Minerva fellowship*, the *2022 Meta PhD Research fellowship*, and the *National Science Foundation Dissertation Improvement fellowship*.

I hold a Ph.D. in Political Science from New York University and a B.A. (Summa Cum Laude; Phi Beta Kappa) in World Politics with minors in Mathematics and Hispanic Studies from Hamilton College. Apart from my research, I enjoy competitive ballroom dancing and summers in my home country of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
